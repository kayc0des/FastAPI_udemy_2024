# FastAPI Course 

## About the Course

FastAPI and Python are two of the hottest technologies in the market for building high-performing APIs. This course, taught by Eric Roby, is designed to teach you how to build and deploy FastAPI applications from scratch, including RESTful APIs and Full Stack applications.

By the end of this course, you will have built production-ready RESTful APIs, a production-ready Full Stack application, implemented full authentication/authorization, set up production-ready databases, and deployed your FastAPI application for public use.

## Why FastAPI?

FastAPI is the fastest growing Python web development framework in the market. It covers all aspects of APIs and comes with a lot out of the box. FastAPI is one of the fastest and highest performing web frameworks available, making web development rapid while leveraging the power of Python, one of the most popular programming languages in the world.
